Tercino project
------------
This is totally customized code that takes an Excel file, fix some stuff (remove line endings inside fields etc.).
Then it is converted to .csv and downloaded automatically.
It can be easily reused for another Excel file transformations by adding them to the code and adding a JSON configuration file (consisting of order and name of columns, type of tranformation..).
